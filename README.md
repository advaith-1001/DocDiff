This repository contains the source code for the DocDiff frontend. It is a client-side application built with React that provides the user interface for uploading documents and visualizing the comparison results generated by the backend service.

## Features

* **Intuitive File Upload:** Supports both drag-and-drop and traditional file selection for a seamless user experience.
* **Dynamic UI:** A responsive interface that shows loading states and disables buttons during processing to prevent duplicate requests.
* **Side-by-Side PDF Viewer:** Uses `react-pdf` to render the highlighted documents returned by the backend, allowing for easy visual comparison.
* **Structured Results Display:** Clearly presents the AI-generated summary, a list of textual changes, and a separate list for formatting differences.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** `React.js`
* **Routing:** `React Router`
* **PDF Rendering:** `react-pdf`
* **Styling:** `CSS`
* **API Communication:** `Fetch API`

## Application Flow

1.  **`UploadPage`**: The user selects two documents. The component stores the files in its state.
2.  **API Call**: On clicking "Compare", the component sends the files as `multipart/form-data` to the backend API and waits for the response.
3.  **Navigation**: Upon receiving a successful JSON response, the app navigates to the `/result` route, passing the API data (diffs, highlighted PDFs, summary) via `react-router-dom`'s `location.state`.
4.  **`ResultPage`**: This component retrieves the data from the location state, converts the base64 PDF strings into Blob URLs, and renders the complete comparison view.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need the [DocDiff Backend](https://github.com/your-username/docdiff-backend) running simultaneously.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later)
* npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/docdiff-frontend.git](https://github.com/your-username/docdiff-frontend.git)
    cd docdiff-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Connect to the Backend:**
    Open `src/components/UploadPage.js` and ensure the `fetch` URL points to your running backend instance (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/compare`).
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch("[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/compare](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/compare)", { ... });
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
